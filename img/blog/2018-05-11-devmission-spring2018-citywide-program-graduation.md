We were super excited to see 16 Young Adults that graduated from our first joint graduation of 3 spring 2018 cohorts in partnership with the City’s Digital Equity pilot program last Friday @ the Rotunda's City Hall. The three cohorts were from the Mission, Hunters Point East/West, and the Western Addition.

We want to take a moment to acknowledge all the organizations that have supported this program:
