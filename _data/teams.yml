As employee 27, he got to see firsthand the building of a Silicon Valley company (funded by Sequoia Capital) that ultimately grew into a thousand employee+ corporation all in less than a year as it was acquired for $180 million by Frontier Communications. <br> That experience and access to his new mentors/advisors, led Jesse to cofound along with his brother in 1998 one of the first U.S. online bilingual Latino communities (Picosito.com) which was recognized by a U.S. Congressional Record by the House of Representatives in 1999 for their efforts around technology in Latino Community. They raised $2.3 million in seed capital and had two acquisition offers in less than six months.<br> After the dot com era, Jesse went back to Corporate America; he has over 10 years in the BPM industry & has worked with industry leaders such as Xerox Global Services, IKON, & Kofax as a Business Development Manager. He was also the cofounder of his 2nd startup – Giggo, a groupon-like venture delivering their messaging all in Spanish. Previously, he was the cofounder/COO of his third startup - Relevance, which took him to Brazil as the country director under the Startup Brasil Program.<br> Jesse is the Cofounder of AVION Ventures which is the 1st pre-accelerator focused on Latina women working on mobile ventures and based in San Francisco. His other personal passion is the Latino Startup Alliance, a non-profit supporting global Latino Tech Entrepreneurs and startup ecosystems where he serves as the Cofounder | Co-chair. He is also the Cofounder and Co-chair for the 1st Americas Summit – Bridging the Americas and SF/Silicon Valley. Currently, Jesse is the first Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) for Salesforce Incubator working on a new venture at the intersection of Capital + Diverse Founders + Impact.<br> Lastly, Jesse was also the Cofounder of Spark America (Intro to tech entrepreneurship @ Mission High School), a program where he volunteered his time in teaching tech entrepreneurship to youth attending Mission High School (SFUSD). The program started as an after school pilot after seeing the disparity between the Mission Neighborhood and the Tech ecosystem. Just after one semester, the Youth Startups program turned to a class elective for credit and Jesse along with his brother taught for two semesters by volunteering their time to this important initiative."

I started with Mission Housing in December 2011 as an Asset Manager, then Director of Asset Management and became Executive Director in September 2013. <br><br> I oversee the administration of all Mission Housing assets, programs and services. I also make sure that each and every day our mission, and the short and long term vision for Mission Housing are achieved. Every day is different! I am often in meetings at City Hall and throughout various San Francisco communities pushing for more support of the Affordable Housing industry. On other days, my time at Mission Housing might be spent with issues like human resources, operations, budgets or board meetings. <br><br> Working in Affordable Housing is very rewarding, and I’m very thankful for finding Mission Housing. The most satisfying part of my job is watching our employees represent Mission Housing in the community, interacting with and supporting our residents and our neighbors in the Mission. Since 2012, our staff has grown from eight people to 25 people! Seeing how we can make change for the better is very gratifying. <br><br> I love working on behalf of the current and future residents of the Mission.

Also I have experience in data analytics. Even though my two backgrounds are different, I love getting insights from the numbers and at the same time I like to be creative all the time. For me marketing and data results work together. Moving here it has been a great experience with a lot of growth personally and professionally. <br>If I can describe my self in five words, they will be Latina, Independent, Feminist, Folklore Lover, and Passionate.
