  description: "Hi! My name is Raven I was born and raised in San Francisco, Ca. I grew up in the Western Addition, and I’ve been involved with the community since I was 12 years old. I’ve volunteered at Juneteenth for the past 7 years and other events in the Fillmore District. I just graduated high school in December, and since then I’ve been involved in several coding programs with Code Tenderloin, and Code on point at the success center. A fun fact about myself is that I’ve met the Brooklyn Nets at my old job working at Tosca."

        I was part of dev Mission’s 4th cohort back in the summer of 2018!<br><br>
        Being part of the program provided me with the exposure to tech fundamentals such as  IoT, Hardware/software curriculum, Intro to Programming & Critical Career Skills.  As a result of the program I was able to: <br><br>
        Disassemble and reassemble a desktop, as well as, identify all of its components. (Hardware/Software curriculum)<br>
        I created a website for my resume (Intro to Programming)<br>
        I created a Nutrition Dictionary web app. (Intro to Programming)<br>  
        Understood how electricity works using a photon kit, which allowed me to set up sensors (photoresistors, temperature, motion) & overall interact with the world via technology. (IoT)<br>
        As well as, to have the opportunity to network with people who work in the tech industry. (Critical Career Skills)
        Having an understanding of how the program ran as a student gives me insight now as a Program Coordinator on how to enhance the program to best meet the needs of participants, simultaneously, complying with the requirements of community partners and funders."

  description: I was born and raised in the city. My pronouns are she/her! My interest in tech started when I took my first coding class in college, programming feels like a puzzle to me! This fall I will be transferring from CCSF to UC Santa Cruz to pursue my degree in Computer Science (B.S.)! Besides tech, I am also a big advocate for social justice and want to actively help get more brown and black youth to pursue careers in tech. I know what it is like to navigate through these predominantly white institutions, and that is a huge problem that I want future generations to not be intimidated by, I want to help end this issue. How can technology advance if the people in charge are not a diverse group? Tech must cater to EVERYONE’S needs and it starts by having a diverse team. I am also a big believer in community, for as long as I am succeeding in tech I want to use my power to uplift my community, because at the end of the day the success of the overall community is my true accomplishment.
