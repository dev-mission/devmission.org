## Overview

The Code for San Francisco (C4SF) Fellowship Program seeks **four (4)** dev/Mission program graduates for a **6-month period** to lead **civic technology projects** as part of the Code for San Francisco Brigade. The selected Fellows will each receive a $1000 stipend to help support their participation in the program. This is a unique opportunity for the Fellows to further develop both their technical and career communication skills with the support of C4SF Brigade members while working on a project with the potential to addresses real community needs in the city. At the end of the period, the Fellows will present their work to the C4SF Brigade.

## About Code for San Francisco

**Code for San Francisco** is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves technologists, planners, designers, doers, thinkers, and activists. Each week, we actively work together to improve the City and County of San Francisco, often using technology to support our efforts. By connecting people, organizations, resources, tools, and networks to build for San Francisco, we will all thrive.

**Code for San Francisco** is a safe space for experimentation, learning and practicing skills, taking chances, and asking questions, all to affect and encourage positive change. Whenever possible, we proactively reach out to those who are left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. Those people, in our opinion, represent our most desirable source for experiences, knowledge, and thoughts. We fail without their involvement.
