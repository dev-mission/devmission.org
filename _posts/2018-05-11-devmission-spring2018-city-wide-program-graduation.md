We were super excited to see 16 Young Adults that graduated from our first joint graduation of 3 spring 2018 cohorts in partnership with the City’s Digital Equity pilot program last Friday @ the Rotunda's City Hall. The three cohorts were from the Mission, Hunters Point East/West, and the Western Addition.

We want to take a moment to acknowledge all the organizations that have supported this program:

The City Administrator’s Office and the SF Committee on Information Technology

Latino Community Foundation

Mayors Office of Housing and Community Development 

The Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD)

Microsoft

Mission Housing Development Corporation

FRH Consulting

SF Housing Development Corporation

5 graduates received job offers from Success Center, Digital Equity Office and dev/Mission to become Community Technology Associates for the next six months.
