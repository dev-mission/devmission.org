FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>

Jun 17th, 2019<br>


Our 2019 Summer Cohort was invited for a corporate site visit to ABC<br>
Channel 7 News in San Francisco, CA on Friday, July 12th 2019. ABC <br>
targets young adults ages 19 to 24 and try to reach the audience that<br>
watches videos on their phones. Lilian Peña welcomed our Cohort with a<br>
big smile and showed us around the studio.<br><br>

During the corporate site visit, we were lucky to have a Q&A session<br>
where the students asked what task the employees do and what their day<br>
is like to ABC employees. After, our Cohort met two extraordinary<br>
people. We met Malinalli and Eric. When Malinall was in college, all<br>
her professors told her it would be impossible for her to land a career<br>
in film, but she never gave up. She launched her own business in 2015 and<br>
ended up in majoring and getting a masters in film. Then, Erik mentioned<br>
he was an IT manager. Before he was an IT manager, he was doing sales.<br>
He never thought he would end up where he is today. Erik is responsible<br>
for anything that has electronic that runs through it. Eric also asked<br>
our Cohrt what kind of career they want to pursue in the tech industry.<br><br>

ABC 7 showed our Cohort their control center, satellites and an automated<br>
camera. We were amazed about how all the technology works and the students<br>
learned how to use the new technology. Our students learned plenty from<br>
this lively experience. We would like to thank ABC Channel 7 News for<br>
believing in how we are creating the next generation of tech talent.<br><br>
