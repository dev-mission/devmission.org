<br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>
<br>August 17th, 2018<br/>
<br>Dev Mission – SF Summer 2018 Cohort 4 Program Graduation<br/>
<br>When: Friday, August 17th, 5:30-7:00 pm<br/>
<br>Where: LinkedIn HQ (222 2nd Street, SF)<br>

<br>We celebrated the accomplishments of 19 young adults from San Francisco and the Bay Area as they completed a summer 11-week training program preparing them for careers in the tech sector.<br/>

<brIn partnership with Mission Housing Development Corporation, the dev/Mission organization provides technology instruction to transitional-age youth, ages 16-24, in hardware (IoT) software, intro to programming fundamentals, and critical career skills.<br/>

<br>The program is unique in that instruction takes place exclusively onsite in affordable housing communities, and youth participants are required to provide much-needed free tech support and repair services to low-income families in their communities.<br/>

<br>The graduation was an opportunity to honor students for their hard work in the presence of their families and friends. Speakers included funders and partners from the tech industry and members of the graduation class.<br/>

<br>The graduation was hosted @ LinkedIn HQ in San Francisco and we are very thankful to Microsoft and Melinda Anderson for making this happen for us.<br>
